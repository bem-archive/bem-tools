# Levels

A level should have `.bem/level.js` configuration file which contains the meta-information about the level:

* the mapping rules between the BEM entities and the file structure
* the tech modules defined on the level
* the meta-information for the build system;

When the `bem create level` command is used to create a level, the empty `.bem/level.js` file will be also created.
It means this level is "standard" one. The logic for a standard level is defined in the `Level` class within [lib/level.js](https://github.com/bem/bem-tools/blob/support/0.9.x/lib/level.js).

As the `.bem/level.js` file is a CommonJS module, it is easy to redefine the level behavior. `bem-tools` creates a new class inherited from the standard `Level` class using export of this module as a class extention (under the hood the [inherit](https://github.com/dfilatov/node-inherit) module is used).

In the example bellow the `getTechs()` method is redefined.

```js
exports.getTechs = function() {

    return {
        'bemjson.js': ''
        'css': 'path/to/my/css-tech-module.js'
    }

};
```

## The levels inheritance

To avoid the copy and paste of the same code among several levels, you can put the common parts into the independent modules and inherit them. This way you can build up the levels hierarchy.

To specify the base level you should export it in the `baseLevelPath` property. For example:

```js
exports.baseLevelPath = require.resolve('path/to/base/level.js');
```

It is also possible to create the inherited levels using the command:

```
bem create level <your-level-name> --level path/to/base/level.js
```

## The mapping rules between BEM entities and the file structure

By default the following mapping scheme is used (this example is for the `css` tech):

```
level/
    block/
        __elem/
            _mod/
                block__elem_mod_val.css
            block__elem.css
        _mod/
            block_mod_val.css
        block.css
```

If you want to use a custom scheme, redefine the appropriate `match*()` and `get*()` methods in the `.bem/level.js` file.

## Tech modules defined on the level

To define a list of the tech modules used on the level export the `getTechs()` function. It should return an object the keys of which contain the tech names and the values contain the following:

* the absolute tech path
* a short tech name — a tech module with such name bundled with `bem-tools` will be used
* an empty string — the default tech implementation will be used.

By default there is no any techs defined explicitly on a level. In case some techs are used within such a level by a short name (for example, `css` or `js`), the appropriate tech modules bundled with `bem-tools` are loaded, if exist. The full list of such techs can be found there [lib/techs](https://github.com/bem/bem-tools/tree/support/0.9.x/lib/techs).

If you try to use a tech which was not defined explicitly and which is not bundled with `bem-tools`, the default tech will be used (see [lib/tech.js](https://github.com/bem/bem-tools/blob/support/0.9.x/lib/level.js)).

The techs defined on the level are used:

* by the `bem create` command
* by the `bem build` command
* by the file structure introspection (see the `getLevelByIntrospection()` of the `Level` class)
* during the project build with the `bem make` and `bem build` commands.

It is recommended to define explicitly the used techs.

## The build system meta-information

To let the build system know which levels should be used to build the bundle, set the `bundleBuildLevels` property within an object returned by the `getConfig()` function to an array of these levels.

```js
exports.getConfig = function() {

    return extend({}, this.__base() || {}, {

        bundleBuildLevels: this.resolvePaths([
            // your levels here
        ])

    });

};
```
